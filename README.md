# UserNamePasswordDemo
App created in Android Studio 2.1.2 and tested on a Nexus 5 Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

A Username and Password login screen is displayed on an Android device.

The app has two TextFields: Username and Password.

The User enters in their Username on the "Username" TextField, the text is seen.

Then they enter in their Password on the "Password" TextField, which is seen for a second then hidden by dots for security reasons.

Now they click the Button marked "Log In".

Their information that they entered is then displayed in the logcat console under the correctly labeled line for their entry.
